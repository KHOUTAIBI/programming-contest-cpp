# Competitive Programming in C++

Welcome to the **Competitive Programming in C++** repository! This collection is designed to aid programmers in preparing for coding competitions by providing a structured set of problems and solutions implemented in C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each representing a different course or training module:

- `first-course/`: Introductory problems covering basic algorithms and data structures.
- `second-course/`: Intermediate challenges focusing on more data structures.
- `third-course/`: Advanced topics: Graphs, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS.
- `fourth-course/`: More advanced Topics: MST, Biparti Graphs, Flow/Cost algorithms.
- `training/`: Additional exercises and practice problems for continuous improvement.

Each directory contains C++ source files (`.cpp`) corresponding to specific problems, complete with implementations and, in some cases, explanatory comments.

## Getting Started

To make the most of this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KHOUTAIBI/programming-contest-cpp.git
